## Overview

Wow this required some finicky style rules. I'm sure I could've done it in a more efficient way.

## My process

### What I learned

* Counter-reset and counter functions for ordered lists
* Styling lists with ```::before``` and ```::marker``` pseudo elements
* CSS selectors like ```&```, ```>```, ```*```, and ```:last-of-type```
* Creating a "table" using flexbox
* USE VW FOR BODY AND % FOR MAIN, not vw for both!

### Continued development

Oh, you know. Everything.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This is where I downloaded Outfit, the font used in the style guide.
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A great resource for CSS guides.
